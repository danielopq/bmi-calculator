## Overview

A single-page website designed to calculate and display the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input. JavaScript is used to perform BMI calculations once the user enters their height and weight, with the option to choose between metric and imperial units. The input data is validated to ensure accuracy. The layout and elements follow the provided design specifications. The project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

## My process

I initially built the website for desktop, ensuring all elements were correctly positioned and met the design requirements. Once complete, I adapted the layout for mobile and tablet devices using only CSS media queries. This approach allowed for a seamless, responsive experience across various screen sizes.
